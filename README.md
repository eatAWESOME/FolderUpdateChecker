# FolderUpdateChecker
Opens a GUI where you can select up to five folders. The script checks every minute to check if the folder's contents have changed, and if they have, it beeps.
The script can be started and stopped using the buttons.
The script also has a "Keep Awake" option that will use the volume up and volume down keyboard buttons to keep the system awake.
